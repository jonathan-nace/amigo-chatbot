A Virtual assistant using Raspberrry Pi

It is made following the nice book on the subject by Tanay Pant - Building a Virtual Assitant for Raspberry Pi (APress) [https://www.amazon.com/Building-Virtual-Assistant-Raspberry-voice-controlled/dp/1484221664]

The idea is to use the Raspberry Pi based Virtual Assistant as one of the interfaces for Amigo chatbot project [https://github.com/sjsucohort6/amigo-chatbot-aws].

Ria uses Google STT (Speech to text) API and espeak on Linux (or say on OSX) for TTS (Text to speech).
